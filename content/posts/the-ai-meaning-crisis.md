The meaning crisis did not begin with AI. It began when Nietzsche declared God dead and we failed to find a replacement. But AI accelerates it in ways we are not prepared for.

## What AI Actually Threatens

It is not jobs. Jobs come and go. The spinning jenny destroyed the weavers and nobody mourns them. What AI threatens is the connection between effort and meaning.

When a machine can write your essay, paint your portrait, compose your symphony — what is left? The romantic answer is "the human experience of creating." But that is cope. Most people derived meaning not from the experience of creation but from the recognition it brought. Remove the scarcity, and you remove the status.

## The Freemasonry Clue

Here is something interesting: Freemasonry has survived for three centuries not because it is useful but because it is meaningful. The rituals, the symbols, the degrees — none of these accomplish anything in the material world. They exist to create meaning through shared experience and deliberate mystery.

This is a clue. Perhaps the answer to the AI meaning crisis is not to compete with machines on output, but to build systems of meaning that machines cannot replicate. Not because machines lack capability, but because meaning requires human participation to exist.

## New Myths

We need new myths for the AI age. Not comforting stories about human uniqueness — those will be disproven one by one. We need myths that acknowledge the machine and find meaning despite it. Or perhaps through it.

The myth-makers of tomorrow will not be novelists or filmmakers. They will be the people who design the rituals, institutions, and shared experiences that give human life structure in a world where productivity is no longer a valid source of purpose.
