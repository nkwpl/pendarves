Thomas Hobbes gets a bad reputation. People reduce him to "life is nasty, brutish, and short" and move on, satisfied they have understood and dismissed him. They have done neither.

What Hobbes understood — and what most people still refuse to accept — is that cooperation is not natural. It is engineered. Every peaceful interaction you have today exists because someone, somewhere, built and maintains the infrastructure of trust.

## The Daily Contract

You do not sign the social contract once. You sign it every time you stop at a red light at 3am with no one watching. Every time you pay for something you could easily steal. Every time you choose not to say the cruel thing that would win the argument.

These are not moral acts in the traditional sense. They are rational calculations. You cooperate because the system rewards cooperation and punishes defection. Remove the system, and watch how quickly the calculus changes.

This is not a pessimistic view of human nature. It is a realistic one. And realism is what we need when we are building new systems — digital, algorithmic, artificial — that will shape human behaviour for decades to come.

## The New Leviathans

Every platform is a new Leviathan. Every terms of service is a new social contract. And most of them are badly written.

The engineers who design these systems rarely think of themselves as political philosophers. But that is what they are. Every algorithm that determines what you see, who you connect with, and what you believe is an exercise in governance. Every recommendation engine is a theory of human nature made manifest in code.

Hobbes would have understood this immediately. The question is not whether we need these systems — we do, just as we need the state. The question is whether they are designed to serve the people who use them or the people who own them.

## What This Means

If cooperation is engineered rather than natural, then the quality of our cooperation depends on the quality of our engineering. This is true for governments, for platforms, and for every institution in between.

The institutions we are building now — the ones powered by artificial intelligence, by algorithmic decision-making, by networks that span the globe — will shape human cooperation for generations. We should build them with the same seriousness that Hobbes brought to his analysis of the state.

We probably will not. But we should.
