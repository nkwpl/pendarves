Every productivity guru will tell you the same thing: build a routine. Wake at 5am. Meditate. Journal. Exercise. Write for two hours before the world intrudes.

It sounds wonderful. It works for about three days.

The people who benefit most from routine are the people who least need it. If you are naturally disciplined, a routine simply formalises what you already do. If your mind works in bursts and tangents, a rigid routine is not a tool. It is a cage.

What actually works: burst mode over routine mode. When the energy comes, ride it. Lower the bar — the enemy of output is perfectionism wearing the mask of quality. And ask yourself the real question: what are you avoiding, and why?

Usually the answer is not laziness. It is fear of judgement.
