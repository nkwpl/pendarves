excerpt: "The social contract is not a historical event. It is a daily negotiation."

Thomas Hobbes gets a bad reputation. People reduce him to "life is nasty, brutish, and short" and move on, satisfied they have understood and dismissed him. They have done neither.

What Hobbes understood, and what most people still refuse to accept, is that cooperation is not natural. It is engineered. Every peaceful interaction you have today exists because someone, somewhere, built and maintains the infrastructure of trust.

## The Daily Contract

You do not sign the social contract once. You sign it every time you:

- Stop at a red light at 3am with no one watching
- Pay for something you could easily steal
- Choose not to say the cruel thing that would win the argument

These are not moral acts in the traditional sense. They are rational calculations. You cooperate because the system rewards cooperation and punishes defection. Remove the system, and watch how quickly the calculus changes.

## Why This Matters Now

We are building new systems — digital, algorithmic, artificial — without fully understanding the old ones. Every platform is a new Leviathan. Every terms of service is a new social contract. And most of them are badly written.

The question is not whether Hobbes was right about human nature. The question is whether we are building institutions worthy of the cooperation we demand.
