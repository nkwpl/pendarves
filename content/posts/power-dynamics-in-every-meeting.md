excerpt: "Every meeting has a game. Most people don't know they're playing."

Robert Greene understood something that most business books refuse to acknowledge: every human interaction is a power transaction. This is not cynicism. It is observation.

## The Meeting You Think You're In

You walk into a meeting. There is an agenda. People will present slides. Decisions will be made. This is the official meeting.

## The Meeting That's Actually Happening

Someone is performing competence for their manager. Someone else is establishing territory. A third person is staying silent strategically, waiting to see which way the wind blows before committing. The intern is being tested without knowing it. The most senior person is watching body language, not slides.

## Reading the Room

The skill is not manipulation. It is awareness. Once you see the game, you have choices:

1. **Play it consciously** — position yourself with intention
2. **Refuse to play** — but understand the cost
3. **Change the game** — redirect the energy toward the actual problem

Most people default to option four: **play it unconsciously**, reacting to dynamics they cannot name, wondering why meetings feel exhausting.

## The Practical Takeaway

Before your next meeting, ask:
- Who needs to win something today?
- What is the unspoken status hierarchy?
- What decision has already been made, and is this meeting just theatre?

You will be surprised how often the answer to the last question is "yes."
