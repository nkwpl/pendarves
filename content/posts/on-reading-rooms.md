Robert Greene understood something that business schools refuse to acknowledge: every human interaction is a power transaction. This is not cynicism. It is observation.

Before your next meeting, ask three questions. Who needs to win something today? What is the unspoken status hierarchy? What decision has already been made?

You will be surprised how often the answer to the last question is "yes, all of them."

The skill is not manipulation. It is awareness. Once you see the game, you have choices. Most people play it unconsciously, reacting to dynamics they cannot name.
