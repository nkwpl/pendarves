There is a reason woodworking shops are full of software engineers. Something happens when you cut a mortise and tenon joint that does not happen when you write code. The feedback is immediate, physical, and unforgiving.

The case for craft in 2025 is not nostalgic. It is neurological. The human brain evolved to manipulate physical objects. When we spend all day manipulating abstractions, something atrophies.

Build something with your hands this week. Not because it is efficient. Because it is human.
