excerpt: "The case for physical craft in a digital age."

There is a reason that woodworking shops are full of software engineers. Something happens when you cut a mortise and tenon joint that does not happen when you write code. The feedback is immediate, physical, and unforgiving. Wood does not have an undo button.

## Why Craft Matters

In a world increasingly mediated by screens, physical craft provides something rare: **direct contact with reality**. The wood pushes back. The chisel slips. The joint is tight or it isn't. There is no abstraction layer between you and the outcome.

This is not nostalgia. It is neuroscience. The human brain evolved to manipulate physical objects in three-dimensional space. When we spend all day manipulating abstractions — code, documents, emails — something atrophies.

## The Imperfection Principle

A hand-cut dovetail is never perfect. This is precisely the point. The slight irregularities are proof of human involvement. They are the signature of effort.

Mass production gave us perfection. CNC machines cut joints that are mathematically precise. And they are lifeless. The eye slides over them without interest.

This extends beyond woodworking. The hand-written letter. The home-cooked meal. The garden that is clearly tended by a person, not a service. These things carry meaning because they carry evidence of human investment.

## The Integration

The goal is not to abandon the digital. It is to integrate. Morning at the keyboard, afternoon in the workshop. The mind that moves between abstraction and physicality is sharper than one that dwells exclusively in either.

Build something with your hands this week. Not because it is efficient. Because it is human.
