excerpt: "The gap between thinking and doing is where most ambitions go to die."

The central problem is not a lack of ideas. It is a lack of output. The gap between the rich inner world and what the outer world sees is wide.

Three observations after years of not shipping:

First, the fear is always of judgement. Permanent output creates permanent targets. Conversation evaporates. Writing does not.

Second, the solution is not discipline. It is exposure. Start small. Ship the rough thing. Let it be judged. Survive the judgement. Ship again.

Third, nobody is watching as closely as you think. The imagined audience of critics is almost entirely fictional. Most people are too busy not shipping their own work to notice yours.
