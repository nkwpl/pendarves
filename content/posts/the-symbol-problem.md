excerpt: "AI can generate a thousand symbols per second. It cannot imbue any of them with meaning."

There is a tendency to dismiss inherited symbolism as decoration — the residue of less enlightened times. But symbols are not decorative. They are load-bearing.

Consider the square and compasses. Or the crucifix. Or the national flag. These objects carry weight not because of what they are but because of what has been invested in them over centuries of human attention.

When we create new symbols from scratch — corporate logos, personal brands — we are building without foundations. AI accelerates this: it can generate infinite symbols, optimise for attention, for engagement. What it cannot do is imbue a symbol with meaning. That requires time, sacrifice, and human experience.

The question for our age is not whether we can create new myths. It is whether we have the patience to let them mature.
