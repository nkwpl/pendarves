excerpt: "Why the symbols we inherit matter more than the ones we invent."
---

There is a tendency, in our current age, to dismiss inherited symbolism as mere decoration — the residue of less enlightened times. But symbols are not decorative. They are load-bearing.

Consider the square and compasses. Or the crucifix. Or the national flag. These objects carry weight not because of what they are, but because of what has been invested in them over centuries of human attention. They are compressed meaning.

## The Problem with New Symbols

When we create new symbols from scratch — corporate logos, personal brands, startup identities — we are building without foundations. The symbol has no weight because no one has yet suffered for it, celebrated beneath it, or buried their dead beside it.

This is not an argument against innovation. It is an argument against forgetting. The new must be built on the old, or it floats.

## What AI Changes

Artificial intelligence can generate a thousand symbols per second. It can optimise for attention, for engagement, for conversion. What it cannot do is imbue a symbol with meaning. That requires time, sacrifice, and human experience.

The question for our age is not whether we can create new myths. It is whether we have the patience to let them mature.
