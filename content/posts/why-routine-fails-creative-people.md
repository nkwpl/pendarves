Every productivity guru will tell you the same thing: build a routine. Wake at 5am. Meditate. Journal. Exercise. Write for two hours before the world intrudes.

It sounds wonderful. It works for about three days.

## The Routine Paradox

The people who benefit most from routine are the people who least need it. If you are naturally disciplined, a routine simply formalises what you already do. If you are not — if your mind works in bursts and tangents and sudden obsessions — then a rigid routine is not a tool. It is a cage.

## What Actually Works

After years of failed routines, here is what I have learned:

**Burst mode, not routine mode.** When the energy comes, ride it. Write for six hours. Build the thing. Don't stop because your schedule says "lunch break."

**Capture everything.** The idea that comes at 11pm is not less valuable than the one that comes during your scheduled "creative block." Have systems to capture, not schedules to create.

**Lower the bar.** The enemy of output is not laziness. It is perfectionism wearing the mask of quality. Ship the rough thing. Edit later.

## The Real Question

The real question is not "what is your morning routine?" It is "what are you avoiding, and why?"

Usually, the answer is not a lack of discipline. It is a fear of judgement. Routines become a way to feel productive without producing anything that can be criticised.

Ship the work. That is the only routine that matters.
