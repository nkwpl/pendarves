There is a period in every civilisation's life — and perhaps in every individual's — where the inherited structures of meaning begin to crack but nothing has yet emerged to replace them. We are in that period now.

## The Collapse

The twentieth century did most of the demolition work. Two world wars proved that civilisation was thinner than anyone had imagined. The death of God, announced by Nietzsche in the 1880s, took another century to fully register in the culture. And now, in the twenty-first century, the last remaining secular religions — progress, meritocracy, the market — are showing their age.

This is not necessarily bad. Adolescence is not a disease. It is a transition. But transitions are dangerous precisely because the old rules no longer apply and the new ones have not yet been written.

## What AI Changes

Artificial intelligence accelerates this transition in ways we are only beginning to understand. When a machine can produce work that was previously the exclusive domain of human creativity, we are forced to ask questions that most people have been avoiding:

- What is the value of human effort if a machine can replicate the output?
- Where does meaning come from if not from scarcity and struggle?
- How do we build identity in a world where our unique contributions are no longer unique?

These are not technological questions. They are philosophical ones. And philosophy — real philosophy, not the academic variety — is what we need most right now.

## The Freemasonry Clue

Freemasonry is instructive here. For three centuries, it has maintained a system of meaning that is entirely constructed. The rituals do not describe historical events. The symbols do not point to empirical truths. The degrees do not confer practical skills.

And yet it works. Men find genuine meaning in the Craft, not despite its constructed nature but because of it. The deliberateness of the construction is part of the point. You know it is a myth. You participate anyway. And in that participation, something real happens.

This suggests that the next phase of human meaning-making will not be about discovering truth but about constructing it — deliberately, communally, and with full awareness of what we are doing.

## What Comes Next

The adolescence of meaning will end. It always does. But what comes next depends on whether we approach this transition with intentionality or simply drift.

The drifters will find meaning in consumption, entertainment, and distraction. The intentional will build new institutions, new rituals, new myths — fully aware that they are myths, and fully committed to them anyway.

The question is not whether we can create new meaning. It is whether we have the courage to take meaning-making seriously in an age that has learned to be suspicious of all grand narratives.

I believe we can. But it will require a kind of philosophical maturity that is rare in any age and especially rare in ours.
